<h3>Introduction</h3>  
<p>I’ve recently been working on several HTML applications and sharing the code through DropBox through my various machines. (Yes I have TFS – but this is sample code). One problem that I’ve experienced is that sharing the code on different machines will result in the following error when the app is launched. </p>  <p><a href="http://michaelcrump.net/files/SNAGHTML802876c_634844172142586324.png"><img title="SNAGHTML802876c"  src="http://michaelcrump.net/files/SNAGHTML802876c_thumb_634844172152882324.png" width="518" height="227" /></a></p>  <p><strong>Unable to Activate Windows Store App. The activation request failed with error ‘E_Fail’. See help for advice on troubleshooting the issue.</strong></p>  <h3>The Fix</h3>  <p>The easiest way to get back to work is to select “<strong>Show All Files</strong>” then expand <strong><u>bin</u></strong> and <strong><u>bld</u></strong> and delete the <strong>Debug</strong> Folder in each. After that is complete the app will launch again. See the diagram below for more info.&#160; </p>  <p><em>Note: The Debug folders will be recreated automatically.</em> </p>  <p><a href="http://michaelcrump.net/files/image_634844173761554324.png"><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://michaelcrump.net/files/image_thumb_634844173774190324.png" width="309" height="334" /></a></p>  <h3>Wrap-Up</h3>  <p>Anyways I hope this helps someone with a similar problem. I created this blog partially for myself but it is always nice to help my fellow developer.</p>  <p>Thanks for reading.</p>
